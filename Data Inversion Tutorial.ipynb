    "__Abstract__. Many aerosol measurement techniques produce raw measurement response functions that must be inverted to properly interpret the data. This tutorial will introduce common inversion approaches used in Aerosol Science & Technology. One often used technique is mobility classification of aerosol using electrical mobility analyzers. The tutorial will briefly introduce the aerosol sampling with mobility analyzers and provide hands-on examples for several instrument configurations. The examples are designed to demonstrate how the inversion of mobility analyzer response functions is critical to informing experimental design and data analysis. At the end of the session, tutorial participants will have a starting point to modify supplied computer code for use in their own research projects.\n",

This prediction of observations, given the values of the parameters defining the model constitutes the \"normal problem,\" or, in the jargon of inverse problem theory, the forward problem. The \"inverse problem\" consists in using the results of actual observations to infer the values of the parameters characterizing the system under investigation. \n",

    "Size resolved CCN measurements have a long history (e.g. Cruz and Pandis, 1997, Snider et al., 2006). Particles are typically dried, charge neutralized, and passed through the DMA. At the exit, the flow is split between a CPC that measures all particles and a CCN counter that measures particles that form cloud droplets at a water supersaturation set by the instrument. In this configuration the DMA voltage can either be stepped or continuously scanned. The ratio of CCN-to-CPC response function is used to determine the fraction of particles that activate at a given diameter. The diameter where 50% of the particles activate is taken to be the activation diameter. <br>\n",

Possibility one is to compute the activated fraction from the inverted data and then fit the ratio to the activation model to find the μ,σ that best describes the data. An alternative method is to compute the regularized inverse from the the CN response function and use it to predict the ratio of 𝕣ᶜⁿ./𝕣ᶜᶜⁿ. In this case the model is\n",
